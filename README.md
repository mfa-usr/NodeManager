# NodeManager

## Outline:
NodeManager is designed to solve a small networking companies infrastructure needs. Manage nodes and keep track of node IPs and status in real time, send WOL (Wake-on-LAN) packets, and provide decent account security. More may be added, at a later date but this is all that is planned for now.

## Scope:
NodeManager is a personal website designed to simulate a basic networking website and common functionalities. It is not meant for real-world use and is entirely designed to demonstrate programming compentency.

06/28/2023 - Provided an initial commit. Currently, I am trying to figure out how to setup OpenID authentication using social networks up for local production. This is not an authentication option I have experience with, but want to make my website as professional as possible in storing user accounts rather than using Individual Accounts which my school project was built off of. Especially if it will be active on the web.
